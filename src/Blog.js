            <h1 className='text-3xl'> How will you improve the performance of a React Application</h1>
            <p>ANS :When building any React applications, a lot of thought goes into how the application should work and end up looking. The least any team or developer needs to do is to check the performance and look out for techniques to optimize the app for the end user’s experience. A lot of times you overlook this action, but in this article, I’ll be sharing five ways you can start optimizing your application for better performance</p>
            <h1 className='text-3xl'>  How does prototypical inheritance work?</h1>
            <p>ANS :The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object, we use Object. getPrototypeOf and Object. </p>
            <h1 className='text-3xl'> Why you do not set the state directly in React. For example, if you have const [products, setProducts] = useState([]). Why you do not set products = [...] instead, you use the setProducts</h1>
            <p>ANS :t declares a “state variable”. Our variable is called count but we could call it anything else, like banana. This is a way to “preserve” some values between the function calls — useState is a new way to use the exact same capabilities that this.state provides in a class. Normally, variables “disappear” when the function exits but state variables are preserved by React.</p>

            <h1 className='text-3xl'> What is a unit test? Why should write unit tests?</h1>
            <p>ANS :Using a for loop, the program takes the information of 5 students from the user and stores it in the array of structure. Then using another for loop, the information entered by the user is displayed on the screen.</p>
            <h1 className='text-3xl'> What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?</h1>
            <p>ANS : Not only are there are a lot of different kinds of state, but there often dozens of ways of managing each kind. Which should you choose?

In this guide, we will uncover the several kinds of state in your React apps that you might not be aware of, plus how to manage them in the most effective way.</p>
